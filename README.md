# Sanderling-V8
The memory inspection features of the **Sanderling** bot for **Eve Online** combined with a barebones **V8** Javascript engine.

This project makes use of the **memory scanning** library from the [Arcitectus/Sanderling](https://github.com/Arcitectus/Sanderling) project.

The V8 **engine wrapper** is currently provided by the [prepare/Espresso](https://github.com/prepare/Espresso) project.

This project is still a **work-in-progress** and master branch is currently considered **unstable**.
